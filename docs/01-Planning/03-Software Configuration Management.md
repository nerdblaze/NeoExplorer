# Software Configuration Management

## Configuration Identification

### Configuration Management Tool

- **Choice of Tool**: Git is selected as the version control system due to its flexibility, branching capabilities, and widespread adoption in the industry.
- **Objective**: Ensure efficient version control and branching to manage parallel development efforts across different release cycles (Main, Development, Build).

## Baselines and Traceability

- **Baselines**:
  - **Main Branch**: Represents stable releases with major version increments (`X.0.0`).
  - **Development Branch**: Periodic releases with minor version increments (`1.X.0`).
  - **Build Branch**: Features and bug fixes, each incrementing the build version (`1.0.X`).
- **Objective**: Establish clear baselines and traceability to track changes from requirements to implementation seamlessly.

## Problem Reporting, Tracking and Corrective Action

- **Tool**: Integrated issue tracking system (e.g., JIRA, GitHub Issues) for comprehensive problem reporting and tracking.
- **Objective**: Facilitate effective communication and collaboration on issues, ensuring timely corrective actions through structured workflows and prioritization.

## Change Control

- **Branching Strategy**:
  - **Main Branch**: Stable releases, critical issue-free commits.
  - **Development Branch**: Monthly periodic releases after basic tests.
  - **Build Branch**: Features, bug fixes, optimizations, each backed by unit tests.
- **Objective**:
  - Ensure controlled and managed changes across different stages of development and release cycles.
  - Mitigate risks associated with concurrent development efforts through structured branching and merging practices.

## Change Review

- **Process**:
  - Mandatory code reviews and quality checks before merging into Development and Main branches.
  - Automated testing pipelines validate changes to maintain software integrity.
- **Objective**:
  - Enhance code quality and reliability by catching issues early in the development lifecycle.
  - Support continuous improvement through feedback loops and iterative development practices.

## Configuration Status Accounting

- **Tool**: Git tags, labels, and CI/CD pipelines for configuration status tracking.
- **Objective**:
  - Provide real-time visibility into the status of configurations across branches.
  - Facilitate auditing and compliance by documenting changes and versions systematically.

## Archive, Retrieval and Release

### Release Cycle

- **Main Branch**: Major stable releases, incremented major version (`X.0.0`).
- **Development Branch**: Minor periodic releases, incremented minor version (`1.X.0`).
- **Build Branch**: Incremental builds for features and bug fixes, incremented build version (`1.0.X`).
- **Objective**:
  - Enable controlled deployment of releases to different environments (e.g., staging, production) based on versioned branches.
  - Support phased rollout strategies and rollback capabilities as needed.

## Software Load Control

- **Deployment Strategy**:
  - Automated deployment scripts and version-controlled releases ensure consistent and reliable software loads.
- **Objective**:
  - Minimize downtime and deployment errors through standardized deployment processes.
  - Support scalability and agility in responding to changing business requirements.

## Software Life Cycle Environment Control

- **Environment Management**:
  - Use of branch-based deployments (e.g., GitFlow) to manage different software life cycle environments.
- **Objective**:
  - Ensure consistency across development, testing, staging, and production environments.
  - Facilitate parallel development and testing efforts without compromising stability or data integrity.
